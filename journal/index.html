            <p>
                Welcome to my Learning Journal! 
                for this first entry, I've been tasked with reflecting on this <a url="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">article</a> about website forms.
            </p>
            <p>
                The article is formatted as a list of the authors 20 best practices for designing your forms in a more usable way. 
                For my analysis I will list the the 20 recommendations, talk about them as a whole, and then analysis some specific suggestions.
            </p>
            <p>
                The 20 practices are as follows: 1. Minimizing the Input Fields, 2. One Column Layout, 3. Multiple Steps, 4. Ask the Easy Questions First,
                5. Distinguish Optional and Required Fields, 6. Explain any Input or Formatting Requirements, 7. Label, 8. Placeholder Text, 9. Size Fields Accordingly,
                10. Be Careful with Default Values, 11. Auto-Focus First Input Field, 12. Minimize Dropdown Menus, 13. Making a Form Tab-Ready, 14. Provide Matching Keywords,
                15. Asking for Sensitive Information, 16. Provide Show Password Option, 17. Action Button, 18. Form Feedback, 19. Never use a Reset or Clear Button, 
                20. Accessibility. 
            </p>
            <p>
                When reading through this list, I realized that forms have a lot of complexity and variety of inputs that I had not previously considered. 
                A lot of the recommendations that the author gives are based on user experience. We want to make our forms as easy and straightforward as possible. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Going into specifics, I noticed some of the authors advice had a degree of preference.
                He recommends using radio buttons instead of drop downs whenever your lists of options is pretty short.
                While I agree that when you have minimal options radio buttons are more user friendly, I think the point in which you have too many options for radio buttons is arguable. 
            </p>
            <p>
                As far as good examples of form design, I wasn't able to find any with a large variety of input types. 
                I was instead able to find a very creative usage of form design. This winter <a url="https://christmas.agota.studio/#santa">immersive experience</a> ends with users being able to submit a letter to santa.
                The fields are clearly defined and well organized.
            </p>
            <p>
                I hope I will be able to take lessons from this research into my own form design!
