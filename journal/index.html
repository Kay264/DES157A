            <h2>Entry #4</h2>
            <time datetime="2025-02-23">Febuary 23rd, 2025</time>
            <p>For this Journal entry I will be answer some questions regarding images that are going to be used in the Every Picture assignment</p>
            <h3>Part One</h3>
            <p>For this part I will be answering questions about my friend Jess's photos</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/LJimg01.jpg">

            <h4>Questions</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>What is/are the image/s about?</li>
                    <li>What are the most interesting aspects of the image/s? Describe using some of the language in the introduction to this assignment.</li>
                    <li>What are the most obvious and the most mysterious aspects of the image/s?</li>
                    <li>What are your suggestions to push the visual thinking and the narratives with the image/s to make them less ordinary or documentive and more expressive, poetic, intriguing, mysterious, or otherwise visually rich. You might want to suggest thinking about the topic from a different perspective or viewpoint, or even rephotographing the subject matter to make it more compelling.</li>
                </ol>
            <h4>Answers</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>The images are about this history of Jess’s hair.</li>
                    <li>The images are interesting in the way that each image is very different in how it frames the main figure, Jess. One image is an outlier in the way that it doesn’t frame Jess. They have different colors and illustrations of both different locations as well as different camera qualities. Jess is seen in many stages of her life, each unique in their own way with unique expressions and tones.</li>
                    <li>The most obvious aspect of these pictures is how Jess’s hair changes. What I find more mysterious is the context around that change. Can aspects of the location, Jess’s attire, the type of photo (self taken or taken by others) inform the viewer of what causes the hair to change. What phase of life was Jess in in each of these pictures?</li>
                    <li>I think some of the images would benefit from cropping. Beyond that I think it would be important for Jess to let each image have their moment but also show how they evolve in some sort of timeline like comparison. I also think the images would benefit from text regarding dates and context.</li>
                </ol>

            <h3>Part Two</h3>
            <p>For this part I will be answering questions about one of my images</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/LJimg06.jpg">
                <figcaption>Tilden Regional Park, Lake Anza. taken August 2024</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h4>Questions</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Why and how is this image interesting? Tell us something we would not know by looking at the image alone.</li>
                <li>How does this image relate to the topic of your archive or collection?</li>
                <li>How does your collection or archive say something (i.e. tell a story) about you?</li>
                <li>How could you consider updating the images themselves to make them more compelling?</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Answers</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>It’s hard to pick one image from my set that I am most excited about but this one is definitely up there. I think this image is interesting in its composition both in color and in shape. What you wouldn’t know regarding this image is that during the summer I took it, I would walk around Lake Anza (one of the Tilden park lakes) almost everyday. You might also not know that this bird is likely a Cormorant.</li>
                <li>My collection is about my time spent in Tilden Regional Park, This nature area I grew up next to, and how that time relates to my appreciation of the land. This image showcases some of my nature photography from my time spent. I particularly love the color of nature, lots of cool greens and blues contrasted with warm earth tones.</li>
                <li> I think this collection illustrates my love for where I grew up as well as my inner conflict of how my place there is a result of colonialism. It’s a love story as well as a tale of self reflection.</li>
                <li>I want to frame the images in a way that makes them look like polaroids. Besides that I might mess around with photoshop to see if I can give the images a more documentarian feel.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Entry #3</h2>
            <time datetime="2025-02-17">Febuary 17th, 2025</time>
            <p>For this journal entry I will be talking about visual thinking skills.
                This is with the intention that I will be able to create projects that inspire my viewers to spend more time on my visual elements and think deeply about their meanings.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the first half of this discussion I will explain my take-aways from this assigned <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills/
                ">article</a> about how New York Times photos were used to "...Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills." In the second half I will talk about this <a href="https://deepseecommerce.com/">website</a> that used images and animations in a way I found provacative.
            </p>
            <p>
                The initial article started off by talking about how reading lots of texts takes patience.
                The article then related that to images, saying that images deserve the same level of focus and consideration. 
                Then the article explained that images should be used in a way that sparks curiosity for further investigation. 
            </p>
            <p>The article goes on to list some examples of how the New York times images were used in teaching settings.
                There are my takeaways as it relates to image usage.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Gamify</li>
                <li>Detective work > big picture understanding</li>
                <li>let viewers theorize what is going on before giving context</li>
                <li>Ask open ended questions</li>
                <li>Don't lea viewers to conclusions to harshly</li>
                <li>experiment with ways to encourage looking closely</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Keeping in mind what I gathered from the article I will now discuss the website I found that used images and animations in a unique way.</p>
            <p>This website heavily uses images and animations. While they are very impressive and eye catching, it forced the designers to simplify their text and font choices.</p>
            <p> I think the animations and images help drive home the messages that they are trying to convey. For example, there is one section that shows a timeline of vision, strategy, and execution. Each of these words is paired with a hexagon grid animation. Each animation is different for each word and aids in its communication.</p>
            <p>The main photo element being displayed is the somewhat animated background of different levels of an iceberg. I really like this usage since it gives the user the impression that the deeper they scroll, the more in depth or root like information they’ll find. Overall it’s a very inspiring website
            </p>

            <h2>Entry #2</h2>
            <time datetime="2025-02-4">Febuary 4th, 2025</time>
           <p>
                Have you ever gotten annoyed about overlays? 
                Overlays are the text windows that appear on top of the main page of a website. 
                They make it so that users can’t interact with the main page until you exit the overlay which many people find frustrating especially since they often get overused. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In this blog post I will be going over some key points from  this Medium Article by Naema Baskanderi called, “<a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c" alt="Overlay site">Best Practices for Modals/Overlays/Dialog Windows</a>.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Modals are often used as a way to grab the users attention by interrupting their current task and switching to a new layout. 
                This will then be used to show additional information related in some way to what is on the main page. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Modals can include different features. 
                There is always an Escape Hatch which allows users to close the modal. 
                Beyond the escape hatch the content of modals vary, for example, they can include the following: descriptive title, body text, image, buttons, and focus design effects.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some main things to consider when designing modals are: Don’t overuse them, make sure they are accessible, and consider how they work on mobile format.
            </p>
            <p>
                I hope you enjoyed reading my takeaways from this article about Modals!

            <h2>Entry #1</h2>
            <time datetime="2025-01-21">January 21st, 2025</time>
            <p>
                Welcome to my Learning Journal! 
                for this first entry, I've been tasked with reflecting on this <a url="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">article</a> about website forms.
            </p>
            <p>
                The article is formatted as a list of the authors 20 best practices for designing your forms in a more usable way. 
                For my analysis I will list the the 20 recommendations, talk about them as a whole, and then analysis some specific suggestions.
            </p>
            <p>
                The 20 practices are as follows: 1. Minimizing the Input Fields, 2. One Column Layout, 3. Multiple Steps, 4. Ask the Easy Questions First,
                5. Distinguish Optional and Required Fields, 6. Explain any Input or Formatting Requirements, 7. Label, 8. Placeholder Text, 9. Size Fields Accordingly,
                10. Be Careful with Default Values, 11. Auto-Focus First Input Field, 12. Minimize Dropdown Menus, 13. Making a Form Tab-Ready, 14. Provide Matching Keywords,
                15. Asking for Sensitive Information, 16. Provide Show Password Option, 17. Action Button, 18. Form Feedback, 19. Never use a Reset or Clear Button, 
                20. Accessibility. 
            </p>
            <p>
                When reading through this list, I realized that forms have a lot of complexity and variety of inputs that I had not previously considered. 
                A lot of the recommendations that the author gives are based on user experience. We want to make our forms as easy and straightforward as possible. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Going into specifics, I noticed some of the authors advice had a degree of preference.
                He recommends using radio buttons instead of drop downs whenever your lists of options is pretty short.
                While I agree that when you have minimal options radio buttons are more user friendly, I think the point in which you have too many options for radio buttons is arguable. 
            </p>
            <p>
                As far as good examples of form design, I wasn't able to find any with a large variety of input types. 
                I was instead able to find a very creative usage of form design. This winter <a url="https://christmas.agota.studio/#santa">immersive experience</a> ends with users being able to submit a letter to santa.
                The fields are clearly defined and well organized.
            </p>
            <p>
                I hope I will be able to take lessons from this research into my own form design!
